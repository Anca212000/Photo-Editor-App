### This is an image processing app programmed in python language using GUI Libraries like Tkinter (tkinter, tkinter.ttk). For editing the photo I used OpenCV library that manipulates the color, size, intensity and other visual effects of image. The app is alike other mobile, online apps that edit a photo with all the effects, filters that user enjoys to apply them.

The desktop app is saved like an executable one (.exe) and when it’s open, the app provides 11 options over the manipulation of an image – these options are composed of following buttons:

•	NEW – load a new image from computer.

•	SAVE – save the processed image at that time.

•	SAVE AS – can save the photo on computer in any image type (jpg, png, bmp, tiff)

•	FILTER – here are some filters for image (negative, sepia, black white, emboss, gaussian blur, median blur).

•	ADJUST – change the colours of the image manipulating the RGB schema of the image (changing the redness of image or green shade or even the blue colour – the intensity of these are between 0 and 255); also, here can be adjusted the constrast, brightness and sharpness of the image.

•	IMAGE OVERLAY – this option opens from computer a new image (the opacity of this new image can be set between 0 and 1) that overlaps initial image and finally, obtain a merged image.

•	COLLAGE – create a collage structured of 2 images having the positions horizontally or vertically.

•	ADD TEXT – able to enter text , select the font (font-family, font-size), colour of the text using the RGB format and set the position of text on Ox axis and Oy axis (the center, O, of this axis being in the upper-left corner of the image).

•	ADD FRAME – add a frame/border around the photo and also can be set the RGB colour of the frame and more than this, can be set the thickness of the border.

•	DISCARD – erase all the modifications added over the image left it in initial state.

•	EXIT – close the app.


Furthermore, the app has an error message box that appears only when the user clicks the other buttons except for ‘NEW’ button.
